config NET_VENDOR_XILINX
	bool "Xilinx devices"
	default y
	depends on PPC || PPC32 || MICROBLAZE
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Xilinx devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

	  This phy is used by many Xilinx boards.  This option includes
	  code for enabling GMII over copper, and for setting the correct
	  speed based on whatever the phy is able to autonegotiate.  This is
	  usually the best option to use on ML40x and ML50x boards.

	  If your physical interface is not covered by the other
	  selections, then choose this option.  This option includes generic
	  speed autonegotation code.
